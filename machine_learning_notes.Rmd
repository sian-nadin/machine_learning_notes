# Intro to machine learning
## Supervised learning

## Decision surface
Algorithm takes in data and creates a decision surface that can predict whther future cases will land in a certain category. 
When the decision surface is a straight line it is linear.

## Naive Bayes
Use Sci-kit learn Naive Bayes gaussuian function:
```{python}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> X = np.array([[-1, -1], [-2, -1], [-3, -2], [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 2]]) #training data
>>> Y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]) # labels
>>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
>>> clf = GaussianNB() #classifier
>>> clf.fit(X, Y) # fit calssifier with training data and labels
GaussianNB(priors=None)
>>> print(clf.predict([[-0.8, -1]])) # see which label this would get based on classifier
[1] # classifier predicts the points above would be labelled 1
```

### Example: predict how fast/slow to drive given terrain features
We will use Naive Bayes to classify whether we can drive fast or slow given the
terrain features. 
*Evaluate classifier:*
Evaluate calssifier to see how well it's doing at classifying points. The metric we will use is *accuracy*. The accuracy is the (number of points classified correctly(/(total number of points in the set). 
There are two ways we can do this:
(i) Write code that compares predictions to y_test, element by element OR
(ii) Use SKLearn 
```{python}
def NBAccuracy(features_train, labels_train, features_test, labels_test):
    """ compute the accuracy of your Naive Bayes classifier """
    ### import the sklearn module for GaussianNB
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
    ### create classifier
    clf = GaussianNB()
    ### note the amount of time to fit data
    t0 = time()
    ### fit the classifier on the training features and labels
    clf.fit(features_train, labels_train)
    print "training time:", round(time()-t0, 3), "s"
    
    t0 = time()
    ### use the trained classifier to predict labels for the test features
    pred = clf.predict(features_test)
    print "prediction time:", round(time()-t0, 3), "s"
    ### calculate and return the accuracy on the test data
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    accuracy = accuracy_score(labels_test, pred) 
    # Could also do: print clf.score(features_test, labels_test)
    
    return accuracy
```

## Bayes rule
1% of the population have cancer. If we have a test that:
* 90% will be positive if you have cancer
* 90% of the time will be negative if you don't have cancer.
If you get a positive test result what's the probability you have cancer?
![](screenshots/q_chance_of_c.png) 
![](screenshots/chance_of_c.png) 
Both specificity and sensitivity are 90%.  Intuitively, given the test result is 
positive, we know we are in the shaded region (blue and red).  The true positive 
is depicted by red. The answer is 8%

### Prior & posterior

## Bayes rule for Classification
Say we have two people _ Chris and Sarah. Tey often talk about love, deal and life in their emails 
Chris talks about:
* love 10% of the time
* deal 80% of the time
* life 10% of the time
Sarah talks about:
* love 50% of the time
* deal 20% of the time
* life 30% of the time
Given this information we can use Naive baye to detremine, based on a random email, who's the likely person who sent this email. 
Say we have the email "Life Deal" we ca use Baye's rule to predict who sent this. There's a 50% (prior)probability that either Chris or Sarah sent this email.
(Joint)Probabilty it was Chris: 0.1 . 0.8 . 0.5 = 0.04
(Joint)Probability it was Sarah: 0.3 . 0.2 . 0.5 = 0.03
The posterior probability for Chris is: 0.04/0.07 = 0.57 
The posterior probability for Sarah is: 0.03/0.07 = 0.43

## Pros & cons of Naive Bayes:
* This method ignores the order of words which is actually quite imporatnat in text. It doesn't really understand the text, it just looks at word frequency to do the classification.
* However, it's really easy to implement and simple to run. 
* One particular feature of Naive Bayes is that it’s a good algorithm for working 
with text classification. When dealing with text, it’s very common to treat each unique 
word as a feature, and since the typical person’s vocabulary is many thousands of words, 
this makes for a large number of features. The relative simplicity of the algorithm and the 
independent features assumption of Naive Bayes make it a strong performer for classifying texts. 
* Naive Bayes wouldn't be as good at phrases. for example, if you were ooking up the team Chicago Bulls you don't want results of just bulls or the city of Chicago so it wouldn't work well in a case like this. 
* So make sure if you're going to use it that it suits the question you're going to ask and test it.

# Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Finds a seperating line (Hyperplane) between data of two classes. 
![](screenshots/SVM_margin.png)
* Greater margin means it will be more *robust* in terms of minimising classification errors. 
* SVM first makes sure to get the correct classification and then maximises the margin.
* Can also tolerate indivdual outliers. 
![](screenshots/svm_outlier.png)

### The advantages of support vector machines are:
* Effective in high dimensional spaces.
* Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
* Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.
* Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.

### The disadvantages of support vector machines include:
* If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.
* SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.

Takes as input two arrays: an array X of size [n_samples, n_features] holding the training samples, and an array y of class labels (strings or integers), size [n_samples]:
```{python}
>>>
>>> from sklearn import svm
>>> X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
>>> y = [0, 1]
>>> clf = svm.SVC()
>>> clf.fit(X, y)  
SVC(C=1.0, cache_size=200, class_weight=None, coef0=0.0,
    decision_function_shape='ovr', degree=3, gamma='auto', kernel='rbf',
    max_iter=-1, probability=False, random_state=None, shrinking=True,
    tol=0.001, verbose=False)
```
After being fitted, the model can then be used to predict new values:
```{python}
>>>
>>> clf.predict([[2., 2.]])
array([1])
```

## Non linear SVM
We don't need a straight line for seperating data with SVMs. We can add a new non linear feature to seperate data. 
In the example below we add a new feature x^2 + y^2 in order to make the data linearly seperable.
(This essentialy gives us the distance from the origin)
This leads to the mapping between z and y which is depucted in the graph in the upper right corner of image below.
![](screenshots/svm_map_z.png)

Question: Which new feature would allow us to seperate the values in the graph below?
![](screenshots/svm_choose_feature.png)
The answer is to map the values of x to |x| as it would give us the chart below:
![](screenshots/svm_|x|.png)

## Kernels
We can use kernels to do this mapping into higher dimensional space allowing you to seperate data using a non linear seperation. 
![](screenshots/svm_kernel.png)
You can pass in what kernel you would like to use as a parameter when setting the classifier. There are multiple kernels to choose from including: linear, poly, rbf etc. as well the option to create your own custom kernel. 

## SVM parameters
* Some of the most important parameters for an SVM include: Kernel, C and gamma. 
* The 'gamma' parameter actually has no effect on the 'linear' kernel for SVMs. The key parameter for linear kernel functions is "C".
* *C* controls the trade off between a smooth decision boundary and classifying training points correctly. The higher the value of C the more training points will be correct, i.e. you'll get a more intricate boundary line with a large value for C where it can wiggle around individual data points to get evrything correct but at the cost of it could be more complex than you'd like it.
![](screenshots/svm_c_parameter.png)
* *gamma* Defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches. If you have a high gamma then the decision boundary details are going to be dependent on the points that are very close to it, which leaves it effectively ignoring the points taht fall far away from the decision boundary. 
* On the other hand, if we have a low value for gamma then even the far away points get takn into consideration when deciding where to draw the decision boundary. 
* For high values of gamma you can end up with a wiggly decision boundary. 
* If we have a low value for gamma then the points near the decision boundary have a low weighting on deciding where to draw the deciso boundary. This makes the decision boundary a little more smoother (as in image below).
![](screenshots/svm_gamma_parameter.png)

## Overfitting
We can end up using machine learning that fits the training points to an erratic looking boundary when a much simpler one would do well, as in image below. You can control overfitting with the C, gamma and kernel parameters.
![](screenshots/svm_overfitting.png)

## SVM strengths and weaknesses
* Work well in complicated domains with a clear margin of seperation 
* Don't perform as well in very large data sets or when there's lots of noise in the data. 
* If you have a large data set with lots of features then SVM might be quite slow and prone to overfitting to the noise in the data.
